This page is currently being worked on! More to come soon! I have created a 3D simulink simulation for a small-sat reaction wheel attitude control system. This simulates the full attitude control (6-DOF) for a satellite in orbit. Implements control and signal processing from an on-board IMU and star sensor with simulated measurement noise.
